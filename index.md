First things first: this site is messy. It is basically an extended scratch journal. For now, it is for me to doodle as I learn GitHub Pages. Eventually, this will have a blog-like format with links to posts, but for now I'm just going to write something.

## Cubing rates and costs.
We roll a set of potential lines with each cube. Let $$p_\text{o}$$ be the probability of rolling a desired set of epic lines per occult cube, and $$p_\text{m}$$ be the probability of rolling a desired set of unique or legendary (as applicable) lines using a master or meister (or other) cube. I assume your item is *already* at the desired tier for this; I'm not including anything to do with rank-up probabilities for now. Similarly, let $$c_\text{o}$$ be the cost (in mesos) per occult cube, and $$c_\text{m}$$ be that for whichever fancier cube you wish to compare.

Generally, if we have a probability $$p$$ of rolling a desired set of lines per roll, after $$N$$ rolls the chance of rolling the desired set at least once is

$$
\qquad 1 - \left( 1-p \right)^N
$$

(testing page now)
$$
\qquad 1 - \left( 1-p \right)^N
$$.

$$
\qquad 1 - \left( 1-p \right)^N
$$.
